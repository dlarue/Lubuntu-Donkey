# improve rPi Camera speed and reduce blurring:
if anyone wants to try to take out/supress "image" blur, try adding this line to the initialize parts of the cameras.py file self.camera.exposure_mode = "sports" this is the picamera sports mode, in theory this mode could push the camera up to iso 1600 and thus keep very short exposure rates. I see noticeable improvements doing this.

Simulator( http://docs.donkeycar.com/guide/simulator/ ):
start simulator, use auto Drive w Rec, this logs data to simulator home directory in the log folder
Exit simulaotr.
mv the log folder to ~/d2/data then train on that data:
python manage.py train --tub=data/log --model=models/mySimPilot
Start the simulator server using mySimPilot
donkey sim --model=models/mySimPilot
Start the simulaotr, pick a scene and then select the NN Steering w Websockets option

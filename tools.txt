# improve rPi Camera speed and reduce blurring:
if anyone wants to try to take out/supress "image" blur, try adding this line to the initialize parts of the cameras.py file self.camera.exposure_mode = "sports" this is the picamera sports mode, in theory this mode could push the camera up to iso 1600 and thus keep very short exposure rates. I see noticeable improvements doing this.
